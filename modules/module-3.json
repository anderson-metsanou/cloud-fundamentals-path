You can choose the size of the VM (CPU, RAM), the operating system (Windows, Linux), and configure its networking and storage.\n\n<b>Amcloud Scenario:</b> Amcloud's IT team needs to host their main e-commerce website on a reliable and configurable platform. They chose a VM because it gives them complete control. They can install a specific version of a web server (like Apache) and set up custom security patches that meet their compliance requirements. They can also manually scale up the VM's resources when they anticipate high traffic.\n\n<b>Analogy:</b> This is like renting a car from a rental agency. You get the whole car (the VM), and you are responsible for everything inside, from the music you play to how you manage the passenger's luggage."

Containers are more efficient than VMs because they share the host operating system. This makes them ideal for modern, microservice-based applications.\n\n<b>Amcloud Scenario:</b> Amcloud's development team is building a new recommendation engine for their website. Instead of building it as part of the main application, they create it as a separate, small service. They package this service into a container. This ensures that the recommendation engine runs consistently, whether it's on a developer's laptop, in a testing environment, or on a production server in the cloud. They can update the recommendation engine without affecting the rest of the website.\n\n<b>Analogy:</b> This is like a pre-packed bento box. Everything you need for your meal is neatly organized and fits in a small, portable box. You don't need to rent an entire kitchen; you just need a surface to place your bento box on."

You simply upload your code, and the cloud provider handles all the server management, scaling, and maintenance. The key benefit is that you only pay when your code is running.\n\n<b>Amcloud Scenario:</b> Amcloud's marketing team wants to run a small piece of code that sends an email notification every time a new customer signs up. Instead of using a VM that runs 24/7, they use a serverless function. The function is triggered automatically by the sign-up event. The function only runs for a few seconds to send the email, and Amcloud is only billed for that brief moment of execution, making it extremely cost-effective.\n\n<b>Analogy:</b> This is like hiring a contractor to do a single, small task. You just tell them what to do (e.g., \"fix this leaky faucet\"), and they handle all the tools and logistics. You pay only for the work done, not for the time they spend waiting for another task."
